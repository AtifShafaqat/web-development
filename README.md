Semantic & Accessible Landing Page

Project Overview

This project is a responsive landing page designed with a strong focus on semantic HTML, accessibility, and modern best practices. It includes interactive elements such as a theme toggle (light/dark mode), client-side form validation, and API data fetching.

Features

Semantic HTML: Uses appropriate tags (<header>, <main>, <article>, <footer>) and ARIA attributes.

Accessible Form: Provides real-time error validation for user input.

Responsive Design: Built with a mobile-first approach using CSS Flexbox & Grid.

Dark Mode Toggle: Saves user preference in localStorage.

API Integration: Fetches and displays data from the REST Countries API.

Error Handling: Handles API failures gracefully and provides user feedback.
